    "What are Binary Options?": "什么是友邦期权?",
    "Binary Options are also called fixed payouts, binaries and digital options. They are deemed to be a simpler and more effective method of investing compared to directly trading stocks, currencies and commodities. As such, they are viewed to be the optimum choice for beginners and the less experienced trader. This is because trading binary options requires just the assessment of only two primary factors.These are selecting the market direction and the expiry time for the underlying asset of interest. Binary options possess other important advantages over other forms of trading including high payouts and pre-determined risk exposure. In addition, investors just need to make a minimum initial deposit in order to commence trading. Binary options are contracts that payout a pre-advised profit for a winning trade whereas they refund a percentage of the initial deposit in the case of losses. In addition,traders only have to focus on determining just the direction of price movements and not their size or magnitude.": "友邦期权只考虑标的资产的价格走向（看涨或者看跌），而股票、外汇等传统金融工具，投资者需要同时考虑价格走向（看涨或者看跌）以及涨跌的幅度，因此友邦期权属于简化的金融工具。友邦期权的收益和风险是预先固定的，收益与否只由标的资产的价格是否满足预定条件决定。例如，如果到期时股票价格超过期权目标价格，投资者可能会收益投资额70%的固定金额，而与股票价格增长幅度的大小无关。",
    "Simplicity is the essence of trading binary options because there can only be two possible outcomes. Youcan either win a pre-defined payout or lose a percentage of your investment. Although binary options are structured about underlying assets such as currencies, stocks, commodities or indices, you do not need to perform any due diligence on them. To activate an option, you must first decide on the amount you want to risk. You then need to assess in which direction you expect the price of your binary option to advance.": "友邦期权在过去被也称为奇异期权，在一些期货交易所内交易，个人投资者不能直接通过OTC来交易。如果想交易期权，普通投资者必须通过雇佣交易商来实现，并且在奇异期权交易所里完成交易都必须支付前端费用。但是在2008年Options Clearing Corporation（OCC）开始通过OTC向更多的投资者提供期权交易，美国证券交易所American Stock Exchange（AMEX）和芝加哥期权交易所(CBOE)紧随其后，不久就将期权交易发展至在线交易方式，使个人投资者得以更容易便捷地进行交易。",
    "You should open a ‘call’ binary option if you think that it will increase in value so that its final price exceeds its opening or strike price by just one trading increment at your selected expiry time. If you are successful, you will then receive payouts as high as 80% of your invested amount. However, if the final value of your binary option is below its opening or strike price at expiration then you will receive a refund that can be as high as 15% of your deposit depending on your broker. Alternatively, if you anticipate that price will drop below your opening or strike price within a pre-selected expiry time, then you should open a ‘put’ option. Your broker will pay you exactly the same percentages as stated above for the ‘call’ option depending on your result.": "期权交易在2010年迎来了爆炸式的发展，流行程度越来越高，一部分原因是这种交易固定几率、风险和回报的吸引力，另一方面原因是越来越多的期权券商提供了直接的在线期权交易。同时也与全球金融市场低迷，普通投资者无法通过传统金融工具获得较高收益有一定关系。这些交易商提供的交易平台非常容易使用并且相对传统软件终端更安全可靠，交易者可以一天24小时随时随地交易，其内在优势是其他传统金融交易工具所无法比拟的。",

    "One Touch Binary Options": "一触即付",
    "One Touch Binary Options trading is somewhat confusing as each of the platforms has a slightly different version.": "一触即付交易，每个平台都有所不同。",
    "One Touch Binary Options are similar to standard Call/Put Binary Options in that you must decide whether a particular asset will go up or go down within in given time frame. One Touch Options are much riskier than Call/Put options in that the asset must actually trade at or “Touch” a certain price in order to win the trade as opposed to just ending higher or lower than the original price. The risk is diminished somewhat by the fact that once the asset touches the strike price you win the trade no matter how much time is left on the contract. If the time expires before the asset reaches the strike price than you lose the investment. Since One Touch Options entail more, risk the payouts are substantially higher than with other types of Binary Options. Payouts range anywhere between 150 – 500% depending on the broker.It is the allure of such high returns that make One Touch Binary Options attractive to some traders.One-touch binary options time frames vary depending on the broker. Some have standard 15 minute to 1 hour ranges, while others offer 3 hour to end of day expirations. You can also activate them over the weekend with the following Friday as expiration. If the target value is above the opening price then you need to open a ‘CALL’ one-touch option. Alternatively, if the target price is below the opening value, then you must activate a PUT one-touch option.": "对于那些善于预测大波动的投资者来说，可以通过一触即付期权来挑战单笔超高收益！您可以在周末外汇商品市场关闭时进行外汇和商品的交易，也可以在美股休市的时候交易美股，并能带来丰厚的回报。在合约到期时间时，价格只要高于/低于目标价格，无论多少，交易者就可以赢取给定的投资比例，通常可高达2-5倍多。这十分具有挑战性，但另一方面而言，投资者不必考虑中间的价格变化过程，加上如此的高回报的利润也是值得一试的。",
    "One Touch Binary Options Example": "一触即付期权的过期时间已经提前被设定好，在该支期权过期之前都可以下单，如果您选择看涨期权，资产价格上涨并触及平台上显示的目标价格，就能获得很高的收益率。一触即付期权另外一个优势就是在周末也可以交易。",

The expiry time is 5.00pm GMT, the same day.Select investment amount of $100. Activate a CALL one-touch binary option.If the EUR/USD touched the 1.2870 strike price at least once before the expiry time you are in-the-money and receive a payout of $500. If the EUR/USD had failed to touch 1.2870, then you would have been out-of-the-money and lost your deposit.": "一触即付期权交易者需要预测相关资产价值在到期的时间内是否会达到预定价位（至少一次）。通过平台，投资者不需要预测价格变化方向，只需根据平台提供的预测进行判断在到期时间内价格是否能够达到即可。到期时的资产价格是无关紧要的；如果资产价格在期限内的任何时间达到所要求的水平，该交易即被认为是盈利的，收益将被支付到交易者的帐户。",
    "Touch / No Touch Binary Options": "一触即付需要交易者有丰富的市场知识，对于认为某一标的资产价格将会上涨，但是不确定上涨会持续多久的投资者来说，该期权非常有用，并且在股市收盘的周末时段依然可以购买，因此一触即付提供非常不错的投资机会。一触即付更适合较有经验的交易者，有极具吸引力的高利润。",
    /*  "You are presented with a strike price. You can then choose whether the asset will “Touch” the strike price within the time frame or you can choose “No Touch” if you think asset won’t reach the strike price in the time period.

Nineteenth century prospectors would taste and smell small quantities of the oil to determine its quality.

By 1961 it was becoming hard to maintain this price, and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand. On March 17, 1968, economic circumstances caused the collapse of the gold pool, and a two-tiered pricing scheme was established whereby gold was still used to settle international accounts at the old $35.00 per troy ounce ($1.13/g) but the price of gold on the private market was allowed to fluctuate; this two-tiered pricing system was abandoned in 1975 when the price of gold was left to find its free-market level Today Gold is considered to be a natural hedge against world inflation and in the last few years together with crude prices and other metals, was highly correlated with world global growth, especially in emerging markets.": "历史上，金币作为货币广泛使用；纸币发明后，纸币成为可换成金币或金银块的典型收据。在金本位制度中，一定重量的黄金被叫做一个货币单元。很长一段时间以来，美国政府将美元与黄金挂钩，也就是说每金衡盎司黄金等于20.67美元（664.56美元每千克），但到1934年，美元贬值到每金衡盎司35美元（1125.27美元每千克）。到1961年已经很难维持这个价格，因此美国和欧洲银行为对抗日益渐长的黄金需求开始干预市场以防止货币的进一步贬值。在1968年3月17日，经济环境使得黄金库崩塌，一种双重的定价方案建立，黄金仍以原来的每金衡盎司35美元（1.13美元每克）来处理国际账目，但在自由市场黄金价格允许波动。这种双重定价方式于1975年被废除，因为当时黄金价格开始由自由市场水平决定。黄金被认为是对抗通货膨胀的自然避险，并在过去的几年中与原油价格和其它金属一并与世界经济发展高度相关，特别是在新兴市场。",
